# Covid-19_Cases_Visualization_and_Prediction
This is a python project which can Visualize the current cases in the world and also in a specific country, can Predict future cases for next 10days when latest dataset is used. In this project I used Polynomial Regression Algorithm, Bayesian Ridge  Regression Algorithm and Support Vector Machine Algorithm to predict the cases. 
I used python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn for data classification and visualization.
